user_description: >+
    I am an astrophysicist with a passion for data visualization and problem solving. Through big data processing, I am interested in understanding, extracting, and presenting the meaningful value hidden in data. <br />
        <br />
    Born and raised in Italy, I completed my undergraduate studies in Astrophysics and Cosmology at the Alma mater studiorum - University of Bologna. I then moved to Munich, Germany, where I obtained my PhD degree at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität. <br />
        <br />
    I am currently employed as a postdoctoral researcher at Stockholm University, in the group of Prof. Jens Jasche, working on observational and computational cosmology. I am interested in the study of cosmic large-scale structures, dynamics and formation of galaxies, and determination of the nature of dark matter and dark energy. <br />
